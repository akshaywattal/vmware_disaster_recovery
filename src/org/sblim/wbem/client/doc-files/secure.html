<a id="intro" name="intro" /><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The following text will explain how to get secure connections from the CIM client to the 
CIM Object Manager and vice-versa (for indications) working.</p>
<p>SSL/TLS may provide
<ul>
    <li>confidentiality - no third party can read the content of the communication.</li>
    <li>integrity - no third party can alter the content of the communication unnoticed.</li>
    <li>authentication - the identity of one or both partners is confirmed.</li>
</ul>
Confidentiality is ensured by encryption of any data sent over the network. Integrity is 
ensured by hashes of the data that can be used by the receiver to detect any changes. 
Authentication is implemented by exchanging X509 certificates between client and CIMOM. 
Note that SSL/TLS authentication is on
a communication endpoint scope and not on a user scope. It ensures that two systems talking to
each other really have the identities they proclaim. User authentication is usually done on
application level (here CIMOM) in addition to SSL/TLS.</p>
<p>The more complex part of SSL/TLS setups is the authentication. If you can live without it,
things get much easier. Below you'll find a table with the possible configurations. The higher
the number the more complex and secure it becomes. Keep in mind that you cannot choose the security 
configuration independently of your counterpart (the CIMOM). E.g. if the CIMOM defines client 
authentication as mandatory you cannot get around it. Vice-versa if the CIMOM doesn't care about 
client authentication you might send as many certificates you want ... it will never ever evaluate 
them.</p>

<a id="basics" name="basics" /><h2>Authentication basics</h2>
<p>SSL/TLS authentication is X509 certificate-based. Each side provides a X509 certificate that confirms it's identity. The certificates are 
exchanged and each side validates the received certificate against a local copy.</p>
<p>To store the certificates two files are used. The first is the so-called keystore and contains our own certificate with all private and public key information.
The second is the so-called truststore and contains local copies of certificates from other systems we trust. These copies contain only the public
key information.</p>
<p>How to create a keystore for Java is explained <a href="#keystore">here</a>. As of today, the SBLIM CIM Client does not support truststores.</p>
<p>The described mechanism would enforce every receiver to have the certificate of every trusted sender stored in it's truststore. Certificate chains
were invented to get around this. In a certificate chain an organization certifies the autheticity of an entities certificate and the receiver 
just validates the authenticity of the organizations certificate. Therefore with just the certificate of the organization in the truststore the
receiver can validate all entities that have certificates based on the organization's certificate.</p>
<p>The table below shows the possible configurations. Note that since the current SBLIM CIM Client
release does not use truststores, the configurations 2 and 4 are not supported.
<h3>Configurations for client connections</h3>

<a id="c1" name="c1" /><h2>"No authentication" configuration</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Confidentiality: given</li>
    <li>Integrity: given</li>
    <li>Authentication: no</li>
    <li>Keystore: No</li>
    <li>Truststore: No</li>
</ul>
<p>To open a SSL/TLS-secured client connection to a CIMOM just make
your client call as usual, but replace "http" by "https" as well as the non-secure port 
(usually 5988) by the secure port (usually 5989) in the CIMOM URL. That's all !</p>
<p>Note: In this scenario we decided not to evaluate the CIMOM's X509 certificate. The client
is free to do that. We also decided not to send any X509 certificate to the CIMOM to authenticate
ourselves. Well, this will work only if the CIMOM is configured to ignore client certificates. If
the CIMOM's configuration is to check certificates the connection will be refused by the CIMOM. 
Today the vast majority of CIMOMs is configured not to check client certificates.</p>

<!--<a id="c2" name="c2" /><h2>"CIMOM authentication" configuration</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Confidentiality: given</li>
    <li>Integrity: given</li>
    <li>Authentication: server only</li>
    <li>Keystore: No</li>
    <li>Truststore: Required</li>
</ul>
<p>When we want to check the identity of the CIMOM we need to <a href="#truststore">create a truststore</a>.
Once this is set up, the client checks autmatically the CIMOM certificate against the truststore.
Everything else is equal to the "no authorization" configuration</p>

<a id="c3" name="c3" /><h2>"Client authentication" configuration</h2>

need to <a href="#keystore">create a keystore</a>.
Once this is set up, the client automatically sends our certificate on request by the CIMOM.
Everything else is equal to the "no authorization" configuration.</p>
<p>Note: In this scenario we decided not to evaluate the CIMOM's X509 certificate. The client is 
free to do that. The CIMOM has to be enabled to validate our certificate. This can be done by either
copying our certificate to the CIMOM's truststore, deducing our certificate from an organization certificate
the CIMOM already trusts, copying our certificate to an organization's central certificate store (e.g. LDAP)
the CIMOM queries, etc. See <a href="#export">exporting a certificate</a> for a description on how to export 
a certificate from your keystore so that you can import it into the CIMOM's truststore.</p>

<!--<a id="c4" name="c4" /><h2>"Mutual authentication" configuration</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Confidentiality: given</li>
    <li>Integrity: given</li>

Everything else is equal to configuration 1</p>-->

<a id="indications" name="indications" />
<h2>Indications</h2>
<p>If we want to receive indications on secure connections the SSL/TLS implementation will require the 
server side of a connection (that's us in this case!) to provide a certificate. It might be used for 
authentication, but more importantly provides a public key for the session key negotiation handshake. Therefore
receiving indications on a secure connection requires either the "client authentication" or "mutual authentication"
configuration.</p>
<p>To start a secure HTTP server to receive indications replace your unsecure call</p>
<div style="border: 1px dashed #3c78b5; font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier; margin: 10px; line-height: 17px;">
<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px;">
<pre>
HttpServerConnection indicationServer = new HttpServerConnection(connectionHandler, port);
</pre></div></div>
<p>with this</p>
<div style="border: 1px dashed #3c78b5; font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier; margin: 10px; line-height: 17px;">
<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px;">
<pre>
HttpServerConnection indicationServer = new HttpServerConnection(connectionHandler, port, <b>true</b>);
</pre></div></div>
<p>Don't forget to change "http" to "https" in the CIM_ListenerDestinationCIMXML instance when you
subscribe.</p>

<a id="keystore" name="keystore" />
<h2>Creation of a Keystore</h2>
<p>Keystores hold public/private key pairs that are used to authenticate ourselves with others
and as asymmetric key to encrypt the handshake for the symmetric session key. The JVM provides a 
tool that creates a keystore and generates keys: <code>keytool</code></p>
<p><code>keytool</code> creates a file named keystore, generates a private/public key pair and stores it in the 
file. Such a file that stores private/public key pairs for authentication ourselves with others is
called "keystore". Open a shell, change to your JVMs bin directory and enter:</p>
<div style="border: 1px dashed #3c78b5; font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier; margin: 10px; line-height: 17px;">
<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px;">
<pre>
keytool -genkey -alias mykey -keyalg RSA -validity 7 -keystore keystore
</pre></div></div>
<p><code>keytool</code> will ask you a lot of questions and finally request a password for the keystore. This password
is essential for later access to the keystore. </p>
<p>Now that we have created a key and a keystore we have to tell the SBLIM CIM Client where to find it. There are
two possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<!--    <li>Starting the JVM with <code>Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<path>\keystore -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<password></code></li>
    <li>Setting the JVM system properties <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</code> and <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword</code> to the
    keystore path/password using <code>System.setProperty()</code> at runtime.-->
    <li>Setting <code>https.keystore.path</code> and <code>https.keystore.password</code> to the
    keystore path/password in the cim.defaults (aka cimclient.properties) file.</li>
    <li>Use <code>org.sblim.wbem.util.SessionProperties.setKeystore()</code> and <code>
    setKeystore_password()</code> at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<!--<p>Note that the first two altenatives will globally change to behaviour of the JVM while
the last two will only influence the SBLIM CIM Client code</p>-->
</body></html>

<a id="export" name="export" />
<h2>Export of a certificate</h2>
<p>If you want to export the public part of your certificate to a file (e.g. for transfer to a CIMOM's truststore) you can do that
with keytool:</p>
<div style="border: 1px dashed #3c78b5; font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier; margin: 10px; line-height: 17px;">
<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px;">
<pre>
keytool -export -alias mykey -keystore keystore -rfc -file mykey.cer
</pre></div></div>
Java-based CIMOMs can import this certificate using the following call. C/C++-based CIMOMs use other tools, please refer to the CIMOM's documentation.
<div style="border: 1px dashed #3c78b5; font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier; margin: 10px; line-height: 17px;">
<div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px;">
<pre>
keytool -import -alias mykey -file mykey.cer -keystore truststore
</pre></div></div>

<a id="csockets" name="csockets" />
<h2>Custom socket factories</h2>
<p>You can pass your own <code>SocketFactory</code> to the SBLIM CIM Client by calling 
<code>org.sblim.wbem.util.SessionProperties.setSocketFactory()</code> on either the global <code>SessionProperties</code> 
instance or the connection specific one.</p>
<p>By setting your own <code>SocketFactory</code> you're bypassing the SSL configuration of the SBLIM CIM Client. When creating 
the <code>SocketFactory</code> you set up you own <code>SSLContext</code> that defines things like keystores, truststores, 
algorithms, etc. Using your own <code>SocketFactory</code> you may as well get around the current limitations of the SBLIM CIM
Client's SSL/TLS support.</p>

<a id="limits" name="limits" />
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The current release bears some limitations regardings SSL/TLS support. We'll try to eliminate these in our next release(s). As
a workaround you may use <a href="#csockets">custom socket factories</a> meanwhile.</p>
<ul>
    <li>No support of CIMOM authentication / truststores</li>
    <li>Keystore/truststore locations are not deduced from JVM settings</li>
